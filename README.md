# v2f
This file describes this repository and tool. v2f is short for "Verilog to Factorio."

# Purpose
The purpose of this tool is to allow Factorio players to use Verilog to describe combinator circuits.
An additional purpose is to provide a simple API for describing combinators, so players can manually
create designs.
* Take a Verilog file and outputs json blueprint strings that can be imported in Factorio 2.0.
* Exposes a Rust and Python API for players to make designs in code.

# How to get started

The easiest way to get started is to make a Codespace for your designs. This takes a single click to do.

[![Open in Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?template_repository=ben-j-c/verilog2factorio)

It takes ~5 minutes to boot up and get your environment ready. Once it boots fully you can follow your
preferred mode of usage.
